# Data Science Journey

This repository documents my self-taught journey into data science, starting from August 2024. It includes notes, code, mini-projects, and practical tools from areas like:

- Python programming
- Math and statistics
- Data analysis with Pandas/Numpy
- Machine learning projects
- Linux and shell scripting
- Git/GitHub practice
- Kaggle notebooks and competitions

ðŸ“Œ I use this repository as a digital notebook, portfolio, and progress tracker.

## ðŸ§  Background

I majored in statistics and transitioned into the interior soft decoration industry for a decade. In 2024, I began learning data science systematically, using Python and Linux, and exploring real-world applications with a project-based approach.
